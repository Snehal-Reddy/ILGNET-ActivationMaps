# ILGNET-ActivationMaps
Inception Modules with Connected Local and Global Features implemented with CAM.

ILGNet is a novel neural network to solve the challenging problem of aesthetic image classification. The orininal architecture is given -

We added used class activation methods to predict which region is responsible for aesthetic image classification. To suit the needs of CAMs we modified the network to make it better.
